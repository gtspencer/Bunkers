VRWeaponInteractor requires SteamVR so make sure it is imported into the project before importing
this package or there will be missing scripts errors.

VR Weapon Interactor is comprehensive package of editor extensions and tools for turning your 3D weapon
models into working interactable weapons. This package can form a solid base for not only weapons but any
kind of holdable interactive item.

Included in this package are all the scripts needed to make a pistol, assault rifle, shotgun or rifle ready to shoot, all the editor scripts
to setup and customize  your own weapon with sounds and effects, an example scene with shootable targets and
a fully setup example weapon along with a setup guide for reference when setting up your own weapon.
